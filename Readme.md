# Log Analysis Using Hadoop (HDFS + YARN + MapReduce)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how large-scale log data can be processed using **Apache Hadoop**.  
A single-node Hadoop cluster was configured on Linux, and web server access logs were analyzed using **MapReduce running on YARN** with **Hadoop Streaming (Python)**.

The goal of the project is to count the number of requests coming from each IP address, simulating a real-world log analysis use case.
