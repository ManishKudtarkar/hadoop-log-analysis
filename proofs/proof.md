📊 YARN Job Execution (Proof of Successful Run)

The screenshot below shows the YARN ResourceManager Application UI for a Hadoop Streaming MapReduce job executed as part of this project.



Application Type: MAPREDUCE

User: hadoop

Execution Framework: YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator)

Job Status: SUCCEEDED

Yarn Application State: FINISHED

Queue: default

Execution Time: ~15 seconds

This confirms that the MapReduce job was successfully submitted to YARN, allocated containers, executed mapper and reducer tasks, and completed without failures.

🧠 Why This Is Important

Validates correct Hadoop + YARN configuration

Confirms distributed execution instead of local mode

Demonstrates real container-based job scheduling

Shows production-style job tracking via YARN UI
